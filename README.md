I want to implement a W-shaped (zig-zag / boustrophedon) coverage path planner for a mobile robot using standalone Python, but designed from the start to be fully compatible with ROS1 semantics (all points are treated as Pose-like data with position and orientation). The system is split into three OOP-based Python files: area_handler.py handles Step 1–4 (receiving unordered 2D boundary points, forming a closed polygon, shrinking it inward based on robot radius and costmap/virtual wall constraints, and determining the movement direction by selecting the shortest width of the safe polygon), path_handler.py handles Step 5–7 (computing lane spacing from robot geometry, generating parallel straight lanes inside the polygon with the strict invariant that start_point[] and end_point[] always have identical length and any invalid lane removes both points at that index, then converting lanes into execution goals), and visualizer.py handles visualization (Python-based first, RViz later). In Step 7, three arrays of equal length are produced: goal_assembly_point[], start_heading[], and lane_heading[], each containing Pose-like data; execution follows a fixed sequence per lane: start_heading[i] → goal_assembly_point[i] → start_heading[i] → lane_heading[i], then repeats for the next lane, with lane_heading direction alternating to form the W pattern. All arrays must remain index-synchronized, invalid lanes are removed entirely, and the design must be deterministic, ROS-ready, and modular, without generating ROS code or RViz integration yet.
